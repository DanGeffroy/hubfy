![alt text](/preview.png)
## What?
I want to create a platform that allow a user to create his own 'hub' with any componant
## Why?
I'm starting this project because i want to upgrade my skill with nodeJS and mongoDB database
## How?
To do this I will probably use 
  - MongoDB
  - NodeJS
  - Angular2 <3
  - angular2-grid
  - Materializecss

## SetUp
Start a mongodb database
```bash
mongod
```

Install the dependencies
```bash
npm run installAll
```

Run the server
```bash
npm start
```
The app is now running on : http://localhost:8080/

## Available widgets for now : 
 - youtube playlist player
 - twitch player
 - twitch chat (independent of the twitch player)
 - simple todo list
 - weather widget where you can select your city

## Idea for futur widgets : 
 - quicknote widget
 - timer
 - G-map widget
Feel free to contribute! I will accept any pull request if they are intresting :D

## TODO
 - add persisance for widget spacifique data
 - Make more screen of the app
 - <del>update youtubeplayer widget</del>
 - Make a new landing page with screen and texts
 - re-Make the weather widget using angular2
 - Make a live version of the app (without dbs)
